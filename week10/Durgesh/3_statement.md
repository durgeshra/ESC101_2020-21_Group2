# Large Number Arithmetic

You are given two very large numbers `a` and `b`. Return the product of `a` and `b`.
Since the numbers are huge, you are supposed to use linked list to store them and perform their arithmetic.

Hint: Using a doubly linked list might make your code's logic easier and more intuitive.

## INPUT:
First line of input consists of integer `a`.
Second line of input consists of integer `b`.
Third line contains the character '0'.

## OUTPUT:
The product.

## EXAMPLE:

### INPUT
```
500
7
0
```
### OUTPUT
```
3500
```

### INPUT
```
500
0
0
```
### OUTPUT
```
