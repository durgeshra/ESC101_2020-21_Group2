# Reverse a Linked List


Given a linked list with a digit in each node, you are required to reverse the linked list in place. You cannot allocate memory for any extra linked list nodes while reversing the list. Doing this will lead to a severe penalty.


## INPUT:
First line of input consists of integer `N` indicating the number of nodes in the linked list.
Second line of input consists of `N` integers which form the linked list. 

## OUTPUT:
The reversed linked list.

### EXAMPLE:

### INPUT
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

### OUTPUT:
```
4 3 2 1
```
