# Reverse Swapping

You are given two arrays A and B of the same size. Write a function to swap the contents of the arrays such that the first element of A is the last element of B, the second element of A is the second-to-last element of B, and so on.

Note: Your function must have arguments of the form (int*, int*, int).

## Input

The first line will consist of an integer `n`.
The next two lines will each consist of `n` integers corresponding to arrays A and B.

## Output

Your output should consist of two lines. The first and second lines should print arrays A and B after swapping.

## Examples

### Example 1
#### Input
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
### Output
6 5 4
3 2 1
